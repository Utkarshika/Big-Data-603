# Assignment 1: Big Data topics markdown

## The following are the answers to the questions.

1. Big Data with example and types.

   Big Data
 : Big Data is a body of information that is enormous in volume and is always expanding rapidly. No typical data management systems can effectively store or analyze this data because of its magnitude and complexity. Big data is a type of data that is extremely large. One of the example for bigdata is Social media; according to the estimate, Facebook's systems get more than 500 terabytes of fresh data each day. This information is mostly produced by the uploading of images and videos, messaging, leaving comments, etc.

 The types of big data are as follows:
 - Batch
 - Streaming
 - Graph
 - Spatio-temporal

2. 6 ‘V’s of Big Data (define each)

 The 6 V's of Big data are as follows:

 1. Volumn
  : Any dataset's size stands out as a distinguishing factor. The magnitude of the data produced and stored in a Big Data system is referred to as volume. Example: Instagram and Twitter.

  2. Variety
  : Variety includes the different formats and ways that different sorts of data are arranged and prepared for processing.Big data includes text, picture, audio, video, and sensor data and can be organized, unstructured, or semi-structured.

  3. Velocity
  : Whether data is categorized as large data or ordinary data depends on how quickly it accumulates. Systems must be capable of handling the rate and volume of data creation since a lot of this data must be assessed in real-time. Data processing speed indicates that there will always be more data accessible than there was before, but it also suggests that data processing speed must be equally as fast.

  4. Variability
  :The data set's inconsistency might make it difficult to handle and maintain. For instance, the consistency of sensor data quality. This is the variability of data.

  5. Value
  :Another important factor to think about is value. It's not just how much data we save or process that matters. In order to get insights, it is also necessary to preserve, analyse, and assess data that is valuable and trustworthy.

  6. Veracity
  :Veracity is a term used to describe how reliable and high-quality the data is. Big Data's usefulness is still undeniable if the data is not dependable and/or trustworthy. This is especially valid when utilizing constantly updated data. Because of this, the collection and processing of Big Data requires checks and balances at every stage.
